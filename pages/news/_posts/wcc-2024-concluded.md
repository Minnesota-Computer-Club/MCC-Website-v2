## Hello, 2025!

The ringing in of the New Year is an exciting time! It also means that our 2024 Winter Coding Challenge (WCC) has officially come to a close. Our competition ended 00:00:01 January 1st, 2025 and the leaderboard on the website has since been "frozen." This means that any _new_ stars that you complete will **not** show up on our website. 

## Year-over-Year Stats

Our competition was a little bit different this year as we only held a competition between schools across Minnesota! It was still an incredibly successful competition with WCC 2024 having:

- **140+** students complete _at least_ 1 star during our competition
- **900+** collective stars gathered by all of our participants
- **6** middle or high schools participate in our competition

This is extremely encouraging as our competition was still spread predominantly by word-of-mouth. We would like to thank everyone for their support and their participation in this year's WCC!
