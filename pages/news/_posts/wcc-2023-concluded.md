## Hello, 2024!

The ringing in of the New Year is an exciting time! It also means that our 2023 Winter Coding Challenge (WCC) has officially come to a close. Our competition ended 00:00:01 January 1st, 2024 and the leaderboard on the website has since been "frozen." This means that any _new_ stars that you complete will **not** show up on our website. 

## Year-over-Year Stats

While we aren't quite ready to share any _official_ numbers, we are excited to share that the 2023 Winter Coding Challenge grew again this year! WCC 2023 had:

- **170+** students complete _at least_ 1 star during our competition (up from 109 in 2022)
- **1,000+** collective stars gathered by all of our participants (up from 936 in 2022)
- **11** middle or high schools participate in our competition (up from 9 in 2022)

This is extremely encouraging as our competition was still spread predominantly by word-of-mouth. We would like to thank everyone for their support and their participation in this year's WCC!

## What's Next?

We have begun our final tabulation and review of the competition metrics. Once our review is complete, we will announce our official competition winners and the final leaderboard for the 2023 WCC!
